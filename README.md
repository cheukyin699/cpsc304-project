# Genetic Disorders Prognosis Diagnosis

## Setup

We recommend you use Intellij IDEA to develop, but not having that is fine
because we have gradle. If you are using IDEA, you are all set and just need to
open this project up and everything will be magically set up for you.

## Running

The following command builds and runs this project:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun   # for mac and unix machines
gradlew.bat bootRun # for windows
```

To find out what else you can do, check the tasks:

```bash
./gradlew tasks
```
